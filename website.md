A Smash or Pass website that scrapes api.Rule34.xxx tags, and displays posts in a Tinder like UI to the user. The user will then swipe left or right on the posts, and the website will scrape more posts based on the tags the user swiped on. The website will also have a profile page for the user to view their smashed and passed posts.

The site features a guest mode and logged in mode. The former does not feature personalization, while the latter does.

A comprehensive personalization system will be implemented to ensure that the posts displayed to the user is tailored to the user's preferences.
